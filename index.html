    <div class="about-content">
      <div class="about-text">
        <p>We live in a universe where there are more stars than grains of sand on all Earth's beaches, yet we worry about rent. Where galaxies collide in spectacular cosmic dances, while we struggle to get our WiFi working.</p>
        
        <p>Cosmo-Irony Philosophy™ isn't about despair—it's about perspective. It's the art of finding humor in the gap between cosmic magnificence and human mundanity. It's philosophy for the overwhelmed, wisdom for the underpaid, and enlightenment for the existentially amused.</p>
        
        <p>When you embrace Cosmo-Irony, every problem becomes simultaneously important (to you) and hilariously insignificant (to the universe). This isn't nihilism—it's cosmic comedy with a side of humility.</p>

        <div class="principle-icon">🌌</div>
        <h3>Scale Paradox</h3>
        <p>The universe is infinite, but human problems feel bigger than galaxies. Your anxiety about a text message carries more weight in your daily life than the birth of a star.</p>
      </div>
      
      <div class="principle-card">
        <div class="principle-icon">💸</div>
        <h3>Cosmic Poverty</h3>
        <p>We are rich in stars, poor in wallets. Surrounded by unimaginable wealth of matter and energy, yet stressed about the cost of avocados.</p>
      </div>
      
      <div class="principle-card">
        <div class="principle-icon">😄</div>
        <h3>The Irony Lens</h3>
        <p>Life's absurdities aren't mistakes—they're signals to laugh, question, and adapt. The universe has a sense of humor; we're the punchline.</p>
      </div>
      
      <div class="principle-card">
        <div class="principle-icon">🙏</div>
        <h3>Galactic Humility</h3>
        <p>Every struggle is simultaneously insignificant against the Milky Way and enormous to the struggler. Both perspectives are true.</p>
      </div>
      
      <div class="principle-card">
        <div class="principle-icon">⚡</div>
        <h3>Temporal Vertigo</h3>
        <p>You're worried about next week while existing in a universe 13.8 billion years old. Time anxiety meets cosmic time scales.</p>

      <div class="principle-card">
        <div class="principle-icon">🎭</div>
